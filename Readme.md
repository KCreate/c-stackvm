# Virtual Machine

This is a C implementation of my [original StackVM](https://github.com/KCreate/stackvm)
which is written in Crystal. It serves as a way of learning C, while learning more and more
about virtual machines in general.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KCreate/c-stackvm
make vm

bin/vm
```

##Â Usage

Keep in mind, this repository only contains the virtual machine. To generate an executable
for it, you will need the assembler from my
[original repository](https://github,com/KCreate/stackvm) written in Crystal.

```bash
bin/vm myprogram.bc
```
